# NLW Expert

## Project
This application was developed during the NLW Expert event, React Native track, by Rocketseat! It is a mobile application developed in React Native, designed to facilitate ordering products from a restaurant or similar establishment. It allows for the listing of products, placing orders, and sending selected products and other relevant information via WhatsApp to the establishment.

## New Implementations
- User profile with persistent storage of user data so they don't have to re-enter it for every order.

## Mission
Create an application with React Native that serves as a virtual menu for a snack bar, allowing users to choose snacks, add them to a cart, and send the order to the snack bar.

## Technologies
- React Native
- Node.js
- Expo
- Zustand
- TypeScript

- Node.js
- NPM and/or NPX
- A virtual Android device or the "Expo Go" app installed on your mobile device (Android or iOS) to run the application.
